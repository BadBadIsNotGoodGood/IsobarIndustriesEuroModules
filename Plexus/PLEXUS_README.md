# Plexus: 10HP Voltage Processor

## ∴ About ∴
Plexus is a 10HP Eurorack three channel voltage manipulator. It processes one input into nine related voltages, useful for macro control and creating variations of a signal.

Red and blue LEDs give the user feedback on the polarity of their current signal through each of the three channels.

## ∴ Features ∴
- Center channel: offset or attenuverter
- Left and right channels: independent offsets and attenuverters derived from center channel signal
- 9 outputs total (3 per channel - 2 regular outs and one inverted)
- Voltage range: -5V to +5V (center), -10V to +10V (sides)
- DC coupled for audio and CV processing
- 2x Bipolar LED indicators per channel (Red = positive voltage, Blue = negative voltage)

## ∴ Uses ∴
- Control multiple parameters of multiple modules at once
- Create buffered multiples with variations
- Voltage offsetting and scaling
- Attenuate one input with precision, with multiple varied outputs.

## ∴ Specs ∴
- Height: 3U (128.5mm)
- Width: 10hp (50.8mm)
- Depth from panel: 23mm
- Depth total (Including knobs and ribbon cable): 51mm
- +12v: 98mA
- -12v: 82 mA
- 5v: 0mA
