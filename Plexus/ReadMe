Plexus: 10HP Voltage Processor
Plexus is a 10HP Eurorack three channel voltage manipulator. It processes one input into nine related voltages, useful for macro control and creating variations of a signal.

Red and blue LEDs give the user feedback on the polarity of their current signal through each of the three channels.

Features:
Center channel: offset or attenuverter
Left and right channels: independent offsets and attenuverters derived from center channel signal
9 outputs total (3 per channel - 2 regular outs and one inverted)
Voltage range: -5V to +5V (center), -10V to +10V (sides)
DC coupled for audio and CV processing
2x Bipolar LED indicators per channel (Red = positive voltage, Blue = negative voltage)

Uses:
Control multiple parameters of multiple modules at once
Create buffered multiples with variations
Voltage offsetting and scaling
Attenuate one input with precision, with multiple varied outputs.

Specs:
Height: 3U (128.5mm)
Width: 10hp (50.8mm)
Depth from panel: 23mm
Depth total (Including knobs and ribbon cable): 51mm
+12v: 98mA
-12v: 82 mA
5v: 0mA
